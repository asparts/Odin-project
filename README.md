# 🌟 Odin Project – Personal Progress Repository

Welcome to my personal repository for the [Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) – a free and open-source full-stack web development curriculum. This is a **work in progress**, and serves as a portfolio of the projects, exercises, and challenges I've completed throughout the course.

## 🚀 What You'll Find Here

This repo contains all of my solutions and code samples from the various sections of the Odin Project, including:

- ✅ Foundations
- 🧩 HTML & CSS
- 🎨 Advanced CSS
- 🧠 JavaScript
- 🔄 Git & GitHub workflows
- 🌐 Web APIs and Asynchronous JS
- 🧱 Node.js, Express & Backend development (coming soon)
- 📦 Full-stack projects (eventually!)

Each section is organized into folders, reflecting the Odin curriculum’s structure.

> ⚠️ **Note:** This is an ongoing project. Some directories may be incomplete or in progress.
